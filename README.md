Machine Learning Guided project
The `Machine_LearningGuided_project.ipynb` notebook is a comprehensive guided project designed to introduce and reinforce core concepts of machine learning using Python. It walks through the complete machine learning pipeline, starting with data loading and preprocessing, where the dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to uncover initial insights. The notebook then covers feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance, followed by the implementation of various supervised learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors. Each model is trained and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. Visualizations generated using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn help illustrate both data characteristics and model performance. Overall, this project serves as a practical and educational tool for beginners and intermediate learners aiming to understand and apply machine learning techniques in real-world scenarios.
